		<h1>Jellicoe Road</h1>
		<p>My father took <br>one <br>hundred <br>and <br>thirty-two <br>minutes <br>to <br>die. <br>I counted.</p>
		<p>It happened on the Jellicoe Road. <br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen, <br>where trees made breezy canopies
		like a tunnel to Shangri-la. <br>We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, <br>because I wanted to see
		the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey.</p>
		<p><br>I remember asking, <br>"What's the difference between a trip and a journey?" <br>and my father said, <br>"Narnie, my
		love, when we get there, you'll understand," <br>and that was the last thing he ever said.</p>
		<p><br>We heard her almost straightaway. <br>In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell where
		one began and the other ended. <br>She told us her name was Tate <br>and then she squeezed through the
		glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead-<br>-just to be with Webb and me; <br>to give us her hand so
		we could clutch it with all our might.</p>
		<p><br>And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved
		our lives.</p>
		<p><br>Someone asked us later, <br>"Didn't you wonder why no one came across you sooner?"</p>
		<p>Did I wonder?</p>
		<p>When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of
		garbage, <br>don't you know?</p>
		<p>Wonder dies.</p>

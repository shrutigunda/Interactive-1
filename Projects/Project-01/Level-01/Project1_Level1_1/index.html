My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die. 
<br>I counted.
<br>It happened on the Jellicoe Road.
<br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la.
<br>We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey.
<br>I remember asking, "What's the difference between a trip and a journey?" and my father said, "Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand," and that was the last thing he ever said.
<br>We heard her almost straightaway. 
<br>In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. 
<br>She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead&mdash;just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might.
<br>And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.
<br>Someone asked us later, "Didn't you wonder why no one came across you sooner?"
<br>Did I wonder?
<br>When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of
garbage, don't you know?
<br>Wonder dies.

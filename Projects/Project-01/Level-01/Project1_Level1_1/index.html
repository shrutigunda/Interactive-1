		<h1>Jellicoe Road</h1>
		<p>My father took <br>one<br>hundred<br>and<br>thirty-two<br>minutes<br>to<br>die.</p>
		<p>I counted.</p>
		<p>It happened on the Jellicoe Road.<br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen,<br>where trees made breezy canopies<br>like a tunnel to Shangri-la.</p>
		<p>We were going to the ocean,<br>hundreds of miles away,<br>because I wanted to see the ocean<br>and my father said that it was about time<br>the four of us<br>made that journey.</p>
		<p>I remember asking,<br>"What's the difference<br>between<br>a trip<br>and<br>a journey?"<br>and my father said,<br>"Narnie,<br>my love,<br>when we get there,<br>you'll understand,"<br>and that was the last thing<br>he ever said.</p>
		<p>We heard her almost straightaway.<br>In the other car,<br>wedged into ours<br>so deep that you couldn't tell<br>where one began<br>and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate<br>and then she squeezed through<br>the glass<br>and<br>the steel<br>and climbed over her own dead-<br>-just to be with Webb<br>and me;<br>to give us her hand<br>so we could clutch it<br>with all our might.</p>
		<p>And then a kid called Fitz<br>came riding by<br>on a stolen bike<br>and saved our lives.</p>
		<p>Someone asked us later,<br>"Didn't you wonder<br>why no one came across you sooner?"</p>
		<p>Did I wonder?</p>
		<p>When you see<br>your parents<br>zipped up<br>in black body bags<br>on the Jellicoe Road<br>like they're some kind of garbage,<br>don't you know?</p>
		<p>Wonder dies.</p>

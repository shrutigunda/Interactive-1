				To die.
				<br>
				<br>I counted.
				<br>It happened on the Jellicoe Road.
				<br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen, 
				<br>Where trees made breezy canopies 
				<br>Like a tunnel to Shangri-la.
				<br>We were going to the ocean, 
				<br>Hundreds of miles away, 
				<br>Because I wanted to see the ocean 
				<br>And my father said that it was about time 
				<br>The four of us made that journey.
				<br>
				<br>I remember asking, 
				<br>"What's the difference between a trip and a journey?" 
				<br>And my father said, 
				<br>"Narnie, my	love, 
				<br>When we get there, you'll understand," 
				<br>
				<br>And that was 
				<em>&nbsp; t h e &nbsp; l a s t &nbsp; t h i n g &nbsp; h e &nbsp; e v e r &nbsp; s a i d .</em>
				<br>We heard her almost straightaway.
				<h6>In the other car, 
				<br>Wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell 
				<br>Where one began 
				<br>And the other ended.</h6>
				She told us her name was Tate 
				<br>And then she squeezed through the glass and the steel 
				<br>And climbed over her own dead-
				<br>-Just to be with Webb and me; 
				<br>To give us her hand 
				<br>So we could clutch it with all our might.
				<br>
				<br>And then a kid called Fitz came 
				<br>Riding by on a stolen bike 
				<br>And saved our lives.
				<br>Someone asked us later, 
				<br>"Didn't you wonder 
				<br>Why no one came across you sooner?"
				<br>
				<em>D i d &nbsp; I &nbsp; w o n d e r ?</em>
				<br>
				<br>When you see your parents zipped up 
				<br>In black body bags 
				<br>On the Jellicoe Road 
				<br>Like they're some kind of garbage, 
				<br>
				<br><em><strong>D o n ' t &nbsp; y o u &nbsp; k n o w ?</strong></em>
				<ul><li>&nbsp;</li></ul>
				<strong>WONDER DIES.</strong>

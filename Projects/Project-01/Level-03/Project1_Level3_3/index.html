			My

		<br>

			It happened on
		<br>the Jellicoe Road. 
		<br>The prettiest road
		<br>I'd ever seen,
		<br>where trees made
		<br>breezy canopies
		<br>like a tunnel
		<br>to Shangri-la.
		<br>
		<br>We were going
		<br>to the ocean,
		<br>hundreds of miles away,
		<br>because
		<br>I wanted to see the ocean 
		<br>and my father said
		<br>that it was about time
		<br>the four of us
		<br>made that journey.

			I remember asking,
		<br>"What's the difference
		<br>between a <strong>trip</strong>
		<br>and
		<br>a <strong>journey</strong>?" 
		<br>and my father said,
		<br>"Narnie,
		<br>my love,
		<br>when we get there,
		<br>you'll understand,"
		<br>and that was
		<br>the 
		<br>last 
		<br>thing
		<br>
		<br>he
		<br>
		<br>ever
		<br>
		<br>said.

			We heard her
		<br>almost straightaway. 
		<br>In the other car,
		<br>wedged into ours
		<br>so deep
		<br>that you couldn't tell
		<br>where one began
		<br>and
		<br>the other ended.
		<br>She told us
		<br>her name was Tate
		<br>and then she squeezed through
		<br>the glass
		<br>and
		<br>the steel
		<br>and climbed over her own dead&mdash;
		<br>just to be with Webb
		<br>and me;
		<br>to give us her hand
		<br>so we could clutch it
		<br>with all our might.

			And then a kid
		<br>called Fitz
		<br>came riding by
		<br>on a stolen bike
		<br>and <strong>saved our lives.</strong>
		<br>
		<br>Someone asked us later,
		<br>"Didn't you wonder
		<br>why no one
		<br>came across you sooner?"
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>Did
		<br>I
		<br>wonder?

			When you see
		<br>your parents
		<br>zipped up
		<br>in black body bags
		<br>on the Jellicoe Road
		<br>like they're some kind of garbage,
		<br>
		<br>don't
		<br>
		<br>you
		<br>
		<br>know?
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br><strong>WONDER DIES.</strong>

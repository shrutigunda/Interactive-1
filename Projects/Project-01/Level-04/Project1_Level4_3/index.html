			It happened on
		<br>the Jellicoe Road. 
		<br>The prettiest road
		<br>I'd ever seen,
		<br>where trees made
		<br>breezy canopies
		<br>like a tunnel
		<br>to Shangri-la.
		<br>
		<br>We were going
		<br>to the ocean,
		<br>hundreds of miles away,
		<br>because
		<br>I wanted to see the ocean 
		<br>and my father said
		<br>that it was about time
		<br>the four of us
		<br>made that journey.

		<br>"What's the difference
		<br>between a <span class="caps">trip</span>
		<br>and
		<br>a <span class="caps">journey?" </span>
		<br>and my father said,
		<br>"Narnie,
		<br>my love,
		<br>when we get there,
		<br>you'll understand,"
		<br>and that was
		<br>the 
		<br>last 
		<br>thing
		<br>
		<br>he
		<br>
		<br>ever
		<br>
		<br>said.

			We heard her
		<br>almost straightaway. 
		<br>In the other car,
		<br>wedged into ours
		<br>so deep
		<br>that you couldn't tell
		<br>where one began
		<br>and
		<br>the other ended.
		<br>She told us
		<br>her name was Tate
		<br>and then she squeezed through
		<br>the glass
		<br>and
		<br>the steel
		<br>and climbed over her own dead&mdash;
		<br>just to be with Webb
		<br>and me;
		<br>to give us her hand
		<br>so we could clutch it
		<br>with all our might.

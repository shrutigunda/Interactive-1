		<ul><h3>My father took <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one hundred and thirty-two minutes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die.</h3>
		<h1>I counted.
		<br></h1>
		<h2>It happened on the Jellicoe Road.
		<br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen, 
		<br>where trees made &nbsp;&nbsp;b&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; canopies
		<br>like a tunnel to Shangri-la.</h2> 
		<h4>We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey.
		<br>I remember asking, "What's the difference between a trip and a journey?"<br>and my father said, "Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand," <br>and that was <br>the last thing <br>he <br>ever <br>said.
		<br></h4>
		<h6>We heard her almost straightaway. 
		<br>In the other car, <br>wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell <br><em>whereonebeganandtheotherended.</em> 
		<br>She told us her name was Tate and then she <br><em>squeezedthroughtheglassandthesteel <br>andclimbedoverherowndead&mdash;</em>
		<br>just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand
		<br><em>sowecouldclutchitwithallourmight.</em></h6>
		<h3>And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.
		<br>
		<br>Someone asked us later, <br>"Didn't you wonder <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sooner?"</h3>
		<h2>
		<br>Did I wonder?
		<br></h2>
		<h4>When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of garbage, <br>don't <br>you <br>know<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?

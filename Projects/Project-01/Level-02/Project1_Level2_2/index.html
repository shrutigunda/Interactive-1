		<h1>My father took <br>One hundred and thirty-two minutes <br>To die.
		<br>I counted.</h1>
		<h2>It happened on the Jellicoe Road.
		<br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen, <br>Where trees made breezy canopies<br>Like a tunnel to Shangri-la.
		<br>We were going to the ocean, <br>Hundreds of miles away, <br>Because I wanted to see the ocean <br>And my father said that it was about time<br>The four of us made that journey.</h2>
		<h3>I remember asking,
		<br>"What's the difference between <br>A trip and a journey?"</h3>
		<h4>And my father said,
		<br>"Narnie, my love, <br>When we get there, you'll understand,"</h4>
		<h5>And that was the last thing he ever said.</h5>
		<h6>We heard her almost straightaway.
		<br>In the other car, <br>Wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell <br>Where one began and the other ended.
		<br>She told us her name was Tate <br>And then she squeezed through the glass and the steel <br>And climbed over her own dead-
		<br>-Just to be with Webb and me; <br>To give us her hand <br>So we could clutch it <br>With all our might.</h6>
		<h5>And then a kid called Fitz came <br>Riding by on a stolen bike <br>And saved our lives.</h5>
		<h4>Someone asked us later,
		<br>"Didn't you wonder <br>Why no one came across you sooner?"</h4>
		<h3>Did I wonder?</h3>
		<h2>When you see your parents <br>Zipped up in black body bags <br>On the Jellicoe Road <br>Like they're some kind of garbage, <br>Don't you know?</h2>
		<h1>Wonder dies.</h1>

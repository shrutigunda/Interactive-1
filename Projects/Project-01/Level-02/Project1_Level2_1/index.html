		<p><em>My father took <br>One hundred and thirty-two minutes <br>To die.<br><br>I counted.<br><br>It happened on the Jellicoe Road.<br>The prettiest road I'd ever seen, <br>Where trees made breezy canopies <br>Like a tunnel to Shangri-la.<br>We were going to the ocean, <br>Hundreds of miles away, <br>Because I wanted to see the ocean <br>And my father said that it was about time <br>The four of us made that journey.<br><br>I remember asking, <br>"What's the difference between a trip and a journey?" <br>And my father said, <br>"Narnie, my	love, <br>When we get there, you'll understand," <br><br>And that was the last thing he ever said.<br><br>We heard her almost straightaway.<br>In the other car, <br>Wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell <br>Where one began <br>And the other ended.<br>She told us her name was Tate <br>And then she squeezed through the glass and the steel <br>And climbed over her own dead-<br>-Just to be with Webb and me; <br>To give us her hand <br>So we could clutch it with all our might.<br><br>And then a kid called Fitz came <br>Riding by on a stolen bike <br>And saved our lives.<br><br>Someone asked us later, <br>"Didn't you wonder <br>Why no one came across you sooner?"<br><br>Did I wonder?<br><br>When you see your parents zipped up <br>In black body bags <br>On the Jellicoe Road <br>Like they're some kind of garbage, <br>Don't you know?<br><br>Wonder dies.

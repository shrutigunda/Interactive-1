  <h1>Thousands rally against alleged government corruption in Slovakia.</h1>
<p>Bratislava, Slovakia â€“ Thousands of Slovakians are rallying in the capital of Bratislava to protest alleged corruption in the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico.<br>
The protesters demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Robert Kalinak, who is a close ally of Fico's, police chief Tibor Gaspar and other officials they allege have prevented proper investigations of corruption scandals. President Andrej Kiska was supporting the student-organized demonstration.<br>
Tuesday's rally is the biggest protest in Slovakia since 2012, when a file allegedly compiled by the country's SIS spy agency appeared online. The file, known as "Gorilla," suggested that a financial group had bribed government and opposition politicians to win lucrative privatization deals.<br>
The protesters also are calling for the activity described in the "Gorilla" case is fully investigated.

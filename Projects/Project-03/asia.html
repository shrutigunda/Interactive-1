  <h1>Pakistan professor from minority Ahmadi sect fatally stabbed.</h1>
<p>Lahore, Pakistan â€“ Pakistani police say a university professor from the Ahmadi sect was found stabbed to death in what may be the latest in Islamic militant attack on members of the minority group.<br>
Officer Mohammad Ali says the 61-year-old microbiology professor Tahira Malik was found slain in the eastern city of Lahore, with several stab wounds.<br>
He says her daughter had complained to the police that her mother wasn't answering her calls.<br>
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The Pakistani Taliban and other Sunni militants consider Ahmadis heretics and have often attacked them in the past.<br>
Ahmadis make a tiny minority of the 180 million Muslim-majority Pakistan. The Ahmadi faith was established in the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who followers believe was a prophet.

  <h1>Madrid opens world forum to seek solutions to urban violence.</h1>
<p>Madrid, Spain â€“ Spain's King Felipe VI has inaugurated a meeting of mayors and civic groups from across the world to discuss possible solutions to extremism and violence in cities.
The three-day first World Forum on Urban Violence was proposed by the mayors of Madrid and Paris following the jihadi attacks in the French capital in 2015.
Organizers said Wednesday that cities are the settings for many types of violence, including terrorism, gang and gender violence, and they need to find new ways to address these issues through education and dialogue.
The forum brings together some 100 mayors from cities including Durban, La Paz, Montreal, Rome and Tripoli as well as international bodies and social and educational organizations.
Organizers hope its conclusions Friday may help cities curb urban violence.
